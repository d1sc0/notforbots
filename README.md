# rate my robot

A silly hobby project I've bult for people to upload and rate picture of robots.

Hoping to use it to play with firebase (firestore, authentication, cloud functions, storage)

To do

- Create index template with robot cards
- Create a form to add robots
- Convert into Vue project and components and views
- Update index template get bots from database
- Update form template to add bots to database
- Create a login form for people to register
- Make sure only logged in users can add robots
- Allow logged in users to rate robots using a cloud function?
- Store and update ratings on robot cards
- filter and sort the index page based on most recent or highest rated or name
