# rate my robot

A silly hobby project I've bult for people to upload and rate picture of robots.

Hoping to use it to play with firebase (firestore, authentication, cloud functions, storage)

To do

- Create index template with robot cards
- Create a form to add robots to a database (firestore) using a cloud function?
- Update index template to only get bots from database
- Create a login form for people to register
- Make sure only logged in users can add robots
- Allow logged in users to rate robots using a cloud function?
- Store and update ratings on robot cards
